# 📘 Java Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Java project showcase! This repository includes two real-world inspired applications — one focused on Java fundamentals via a console-based task manager, and another using Spring Boot (with a React frontend) for building a full-stack task management system.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. 🖥️ Task Manager Console App

A command-line task manager to manage your daily to-dos. This project strengthens core Java knowledge including OOP, collections, and file handling.

**🔧 Features:**
- Add, edit, delete, and view tasks
- Task priority, due date, and status tracking
- Data saved to local file system

**🛠️ Technologies:**
- Java 17
- Java Collections (List, Map)
- File I/O

**📂 Location:** `/taskmanager-console`

### 2. 🌐 Task Manager - Spring Boot + React (Full Stack)

A full-stack task management application. Backend is built with Spring Boot exposing REST APIs, and frontend is a minimal React UI for consuming those APIs. Focused more on backend implementation.

**🔧 Features:**
- Create, update, delete, and fetch tasks via REST APIs
- Task filtering and search
- React UI (minimal), can be expanded further
- In-memory database (H2) used for development

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
- Spring Boot (Java 17)
- Spring Web, Spring Data JPA
- Postgresql Database
- React (Frontend)
- Fetch for API calls

## 🔍 Learning Objectives

- Practice Java programming fundamentals
- Build and document real-world projects
- Understand how backend REST APIs work
- Gain experience integrating backend with a React frontend
